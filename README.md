Final Deliverable to include Sckit Learn Pipelines for Grid Search of Best Parameters for Each of Developed Models!
There are some python files that have filenames that end with tuning that have hyperparameter tuning, but they need significant cleanup prior to final.

Also, need to complete Feature Engineering to check for Improvement in Model Predictability.

Preliminary federated learning implementation with PyTorch and PySft is included herein.

Note that the train.csv and test.csv are only for the federated ML modeling. 

Final Deliverables to include better model refinement and cleanup.
